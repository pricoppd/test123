### Visibility
Set each goal’s visibility to **Self & Managers** (or according to your organization’s guidelines).

### Selecting Skills
If your system requires selecting skills, consider choosing from areas such as **Cloud Computing**, **DevOps**, **Automation**, **AI/ML**, **Azure Services**, and **Infrastructure as Code**. Pick the 3–5 that most closely align with each goal.

These examples can be adapted to fit the specific character limits and requirements of your development planning tool.
