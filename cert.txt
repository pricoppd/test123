4. Automate Creation of Centralized Azure DevOps Service Connections
Action Item
Automate the process of creating Azure DevOps service connections in a central “hub” project and share these connections with relevant Azure DevOps projects, improving efficiency and governance.

Development Actions to be Taken

Research best practices and available tools (e.g., Azure DevOps REST API, PowerShell scripts, Terraform) for automating service connection creation.
Design a repeatable process or pipeline that creates and configures service connections in a designated “central” project.
Implement a sharing mechanism that allows other Azure DevOps projects to use these centrally managed service connections.
Test the automation with a pilot project, gather feedback, and refine the process.
Measures of Success

Successful deployment of automated scripts or pipelines that create and share service connections without manual intervention.
Reduction in the time and effort required to set up new service connections across projects.
Documented process or runbook for managing and maintaining centralized service connections.
Positive feedback from project owners or stakeholders on the streamlined setup experience.
Support Required

Collaboration with the DevOps team or platform owners to define governance rules and permissions.
Access to test environments for trial runs of the automation.
Potential budget or time allocation for script or pipeline development.
Purpose of Goal
Achieving in Current Role (enhancing operational efficiency and standardizing DevOps processes).
