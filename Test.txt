It seems there might be a mismatch in the variable type declaration for `admin_ssh_public_key`. The `default` value you provided is a string, but the `type` is declared as `string`. If you intend to have multiple SSH public keys (which seems likely based on the previous discussion), you should declare it as a list of strings. Here's the corrected variable declaration:

```hcl
variable "admin_ssh_public_key" {
  type        = list(string)
  sensitive   = true
  default     = ["ssh-rsa FAIjferj209332j0rj209rj32r9j32r0932jr28h9hf4wiejf02jf0932jf-32jf-932j"]
}
```

Now, `admin_ssh_public_key` is declared as a list of strings. If you have multiple SSH public keys, you can add them to the list. The `sensitive = true` option is also included to treat the variable as sensitive, which means its values won't be shown in logs or command output.

Make sure to update your Terraform code accordingly, especially in the dynamic block we discussed earlier.


Yes, both Version 1 and Version 2 provided in earlier responses should work with the updated variable declaration for `admin_ssh_public_key` as a list of strings. Here's a recap:

### Version 1:
```hcl
dynamic "admin_ssh_key" {
  for_each = var.admin_ssh_public_key != [] ? toset(var.admin_ssh_public_key) : [null]

  content {
    username    = var.admin_username
    public_key  = admin_ssh_key.value
  }
}
```

### Version 2:
```hcl
dynamic "admin_ssh_key" {
  for_each = var.admin_ssh_public_key != [] ? [1] : []

  content {
    username    = var.admin_username
    public_key  = var.admin_ssh_public_key[0]
  }
}
```

These versions are designed to handle the case where `admin_ssh_public_key` is a list of strings. If `admin_ssh_public_key` is empty, it will either use `[null]` or `[1]` as a placeholder to ensure that the dynamic block is created.

Make sure to use the corrected variable declaration for `admin_ssh_public_key` as a list of strings in your Terraform code. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask!
