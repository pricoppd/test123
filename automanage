Azure Automanage Machine Configuration (formerly Azure Policy Guest Configuration) integrates with Azure Policy to provide management and automation  VMs. 
Pros:
•	Centralized configuration management: Manage VM configurations from a single location, ensuring consistency and compliance.
•	Code-based configuration: Define configurations using scripts
•	Granular control: Target specific groups of VMs with customized configurations based on their roles or requirements. Apply to a management group, subscription, or resource group.
•	Auditing and reporting: Track configuration compliance and generate reports for improved visibility and control.
Cons:
•	Limited platform support: Currently supports Windows and Linux, not other operating systems.
•	Potential security risks: Improperly configured scripts could introduce security risks.
•	Reliance on Guest Configuration Extension: VMs require the extension installed and running for policies to be applied.
•	Cost: Pay-per-server, per-month pricing model can be expensive for large deployments.

Step-by-step configuration process:
1.	Prerequisites:
o	An Azure subscription with the Microsoft.GuestConfiguration resource provider registered.
o	VMs with the Azure Policy Guest Configuration extension installed and enabled.
o	Define your desired configuration settings and security policies.
2.	Create an Azure Policy definition:
o	Use the Azure portal or tools like Azure CLI or PowerShell to create a policy definition.
o	Define the policy parameters, including the configuration profile (DevTest, Production, or Custom) and any applicable settings.
3.	Enable Automanage for VMs:
o	Choose the appropriate built-in policy depending on your configuration profile:
	"Configure virtual machines to be onboarded to Azure Automanage (DevTest or Production)"
	"Configure virtual machines to be onboarded to Azure Automanage with Custom Configuration Profile"
o	Assign the chosen policy to the desired management group, subscription, or resource group.
4.	Optional: Create a custom configuration profile (if using the custom policy):
o	Define the specific configuration settings you want to apply to your VMs in a JSON file.
o	Upload the JSON file to Azure and reference it in the custom policy definition.
5.	Monitor and manage:
o	Use Azure Policy and Azure Monitor to track policy compliance and VM health.
o	Manage assigned configurations and adjust policies as needed.
