### Azure Automanage (formerly Azure Policy Guest Configuration)

**Pros:**
- **Centralized configuration management:** Manage VM configurations from a single location, ensuring consistency and compliance.
- **Code-based configuration:** Define configurations using scripts.
- **Granular control:** Target specific groups of VMs with customized configurations based on their roles or requirements. Apply to a management group, subscription, or resource group.
- **Auditing and reporting:** Track configuration compliance and generate reports for improved visibility and control.

**Cons:**
- **Limited platform support:** Currently supports Windows and Linux, not other operating systems.
- **Potential security risks:** Improperly configured scripts could introduce security risks.
- **Reliance on Guest Configuration Extension:** VMs require the extension installed and running for policies to be applied.
- **Cost:** Pay-per-server, per-month pricing model can be expensive for large deployments.

**Key Points:**
- Change tracking is not available when using AAMC independently.
- Enroll in Azure Automanage to access the change tracking feature.

**Configuration Process:**
1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Azure subscription with the Microsoft.GuestConfiguration resource provider registered.
   - VMs with the Azure Policy Guest Configuration extension installed and enabled.
   - Define desired configuration settings and security policies.
2. **Create an Azure Policy definition:**
   - Use Azure portal, Azure CLI, or PowerShell to create a policy definition.
   - Define policy parameters, including the configuration profile (DevTest, Production, or Custom) and any applicable settings.
3. **Enable Automanage for VMs:**
   - Choose the appropriate built-in policy depending on the configuration profile.
   - Assign the chosen policy to the desired management group, subscription, or resource group.
4. **Optional: Create a custom configuration profile (if using the custom policy):**
   - Define specific configuration settings in a JSON file.
   - Upload the JSON file to Azure and reference it in the custom policy definition.
5. **Monitor and manage:**
   - Use Azure Policy and Azure Monitor to track policy compliance and VM health.
   - Manage assigned configurations and adjust policies as needed.

### Ansible

**Overview:**
Ansible is an open-source automation tool that enables configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It uses YAML syntax for defining automation tasks.

**Pros:**
1. **Flexibility and Customization:**
   - Ansible allows for a high degree of flexibility in defining automation tasks through its declarative YAML syntax.
2. **Multi-Cloud Support:**
   - Not limited to any specific cloud provider, including Azure. Supports multi-cloud environments.
3. **Agentless Architecture:**
   - Operates in an agentless mode, simplifying deployment and reducing potential security risks.
4. **Community and Ecosystem:**
   - Large and active community, providing extensive support, documentation, and a rich ecosystem of roles and modules.
5. **Idempotent Nature:**
   - Designed to be idempotent, ensuring consistency and reliability in configuration management tasks.

**Cons:**
1. **Learning Curve:**
   - YAML syntax and Ansible-specific concepts may pose a learning curve for some users.
2. **Limited Native Integrations:**
   - May lack some native integrations and features available in Azure-native tools.
3. **Stateful Operations Challenges:**
   - Primarily designed for stateless operations; managing stateful applications may require additional considerations.
4. **Less Suited for Real-Time Monitoring:**
   - Primarily focused on configuration management and automation, not real-time monitoring.
5. **Steep Initial Setup for Large Environments:**
   - Initial setup for large and complex environments may be challenging.

**Configuration Process:**
- Define Pipeline Stages:
  - Stage 1: Terraform deployment.
  - Stage 2: Ansible configuration.
- Configure Ansible Stage:
  - Define an Ansible task in the second stage.
  - Secure Credentials:
    - Use Azure Key Vault to store sensitive credentials.
    - Access secrets in your pipeline using Azure Pipelines variables.
  - Store Ansible Scripts in Azure Storage:
    - Upload scripts and configuration files to an Azure Storage container.
  - Generate SAS Token:
    - Generate a SAS token for the Azure Storage container.
  - Download Scripts in Azure DevOps Pipeline:
    - During the pipeline execution, use a script or task to download scripts from Azure Storage.
  - Run the Scripts:
    - Run the scripts/playbooks as a task after the virtual machine/s are deployed.

### Terraform with Custom Script Extension

**Overview:**
Terraform allows the definition of infrastructure as code, enabling a standardized, version-controlled, and reproducible approach to infrastructure provisioning.

**Pros:**
1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Approach:**
   - Enables standardized, version-controlled, and reproducible infrastructure provisioning.
2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - Supports multiple cloud providers and infrastructure platforms.
3. **Declarative Configuration Language:**
   - Uses a declarative configuration language, reducing the risk of configuration drift.
4. **Customization with Script Extension:**
   - Allows execution of custom scripts on virtual machines for additional customization.
5. **Scalability and Reusability:**
   - Configurations can be designed for scalability and reusability.

**Cons:**
1. **Scripts Not Captured in State:**
   - Execution of scripts using the Terraform Custom Script Extension is typically not captured in the Terraform state.
2. **Potential for Complexity in Configurations:**
   - Managing Terraform configurations may become challenging as configurations grow in complexity.
3. **Dependency on External Scripts:**
   - Custom Script Extension introduces a dependency on external scripts, requiring careful management and versioning.
4. **Limited Native Error Handling:**
   - Terraform error handling is limited, making debugging complex configurations challenging.
5. **State Management Challenges:**
   - Managing and maintaining the Terraform state file can become a challenge, especially in distributed or collaborative environments.

**Configuration Process:**
- Store Ansible Scripts in Azure Storage:
  - Upload scripts and configuration files to an Azure Storage container.
- Generate SAS Token:
  - Generate a SAS token for the Azure Storage container.
- Download Scripts in Azure DevOps Pipeline:
  - During the pipeline execution, use a script or task to download scripts from Azure Storage.
- Run the Scripts:
  - Run the scripts using the Terraform extension.
