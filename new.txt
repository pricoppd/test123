"Vault" in Ansible serves as a robust solution for encrypting sensitive data within files, such as passwords or keys. This ensures that this sensitive information remains secure instead of being exposed as plain text within your playbooks or roles. These encrypted "Vault" files can be conveniently distributed and stored alongside your playbooks or source code, safeguarding sensitive data.

The management of "Vault" files is facilitated by the command-line tool called ansible-vault. This tool allows you to edit and view encrypted files. In command-line Ansible, you can employ the --ask-vault-pass flag to interact with these encrypted files. Within our Ansible Tower-driven processes and playbooks, we securely store the "Vault Password" as part of the Machine credential, which is utilized when executing our jobs and playbooks.

During runtime, if Ansible encounters an attempt to access a "Vault" encrypted file, it leverages the "Vault Password" defined within the Machine credential to interact with the file and retrieve its contents.

It's important to note that "Vault" primarily operates as a command-line tool, and there is currently no IntelliJ plug-in available for managing "Vault" files. Therefore, updating these encrypted files must be performed through the command-line using ansible-vault. Additionally, these files can be managed in a Git repository, making use of Git for version control and collaborative development.
